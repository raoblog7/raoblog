Pawan, who has studied up to the tenth standard, had never stepped out of Nosariya village in Bikaner district but still tried to improve the lives of many women by providing them basic literacy.\r\n\r\nFour months ago, when Pawan heard of a tie and dye training workshop to be conducted in her village, she was excited as it was a ray of hope for her to enhance her skills and add to the income of her family. Hailing from a conservative background where women barely walk out of their homes, initially no other woman joined Pawan. She started attending the training alone, but within a week, she was accompanied by 20 other women of her village. â??Ever since I have learned the art of tie and dye, I have got a new level of confidence, apart from earning money from it,â?? Pawan told VillageSquare.in.\r\n\r\nPawan is the second child of her parents. Her father Kishore Singh Shekhawat is a farmer. To make ends meet, her elder brother has migrated to Surat in Gujarat to earn a living. Pawanâ??s younger sister studies in class 8 and her mother looks after the cattle.\r\n\r\nNosariyaâ??s people\r\n\r\nThe population of Nosariya is about 500 where 80% are Shekhawats. Hailing originally from Amber and Jaipur, Shekhawat is a sub-clan of Kachwaha Rajputs found mainly in Rajasthan. The remaining population of the village consists of Dalits, who remain neglected by the majority. Most of the people earn a livelihood by selling dairy products to nearby villages. Most households have men who have migrated to cities in search of work.\r\n\r\nYou might also enjoy reading: Pickles For A living? 3 Bengaluru Women Are Empowering Rural Women With A Homegrown Project\r\n\r\nIn Nosariya, high school education for girls is considered more than enough. Boys complete their schooling and move out for work, leaving behind their families with almost negligible options for livelihoods. In case a girl wants to study further or work, she is not allowed to move out unless she is married. Married ones can, however, move out of the village with their respective husbands but lack of education wonâ??t get them work.\r\n\r\nThanks to Pawan, many people in her village are letting their daughters study and develop handicraft skills through the limited resources available in Nosariya. This initiative of Pawan has opened gates for womenâ??s empowerment in the village.\r\nâ??They had the skill which needed to be groomed.â??\r\n\r\nWalking up to every individualâ??s door step and begging them to come to the day care center seems to be worth it now,â?? Pawan told VillageSquare.in.\r\n\r\nTie and dye\r\n\r\nTie and dye has quite a colorful history in the textile industry of India. It is amongst the oldest traditions of Rajasthan that is still in practice. As the name suggests, the art involves tying and dyeing of fabrics into various colors to bring out various patterns out of which Leherriya (wave) and Bandhej are the most common. Jodhpur and Sikar, are, known for its biggest commercial markets.\r\n\r\nNot only Nosariya has experienced the winds of change due to this art form but the nearby villages are also following the same track for an improved livelihood. Napasar, Sri Dungargarh, Parvati Talai are some of those villages where similar trainings are ongoing.\r\n\r\nThe number of earning females has recently risen from zero to 30 in the village and urge of finding employment has brought over 300 women and girls to the different day care centers of nearby villages for the trainings. Seeing this new source of income, women who claimed to have no skills other than doing household chore are now convinced to attend the trainings organised in their villages. These skill development trainings are introducing women to their own artistic side like never before, making them self-confident, and most importantly, preparing them to earn from it.\r\n\r\nA trainee, Baby Kanwar had to walk 5 km under the hot sun of summer to reach the training center. 40-year-old Baby would come to attend the training at Nosariya in order to learn the technique of tying. She said she always wanted to learn this but wasnâ??t allowed to move out of her village. When she came to know of the workshop near her village, she decided to join. Baby got an A grade for her performance in the training and is working on her first order already.\r\n\r\nYou might also enjoy reading: How Indiaâ??s First Bank For Rural Women Has Changed Over 3 Lakh Lives\r\n\r\nAll this has been possible because of Urmul, a Bikaner-based NGO. This skill development training was conducted in Nosariya under the income growth program of the organization. By conducting the 15-day tie and dye training workshop under the supervision of professional trainers, Urmul not only helped the women be self-employed but also gave their art a platform of exposure.\r\n\r\nTrial and success\r\n\r\nWith every passing day, there is a rise in the number of women trainees as larger numbers of women realize that this could be a viable means of earning from home. For some, the first challenge was to get permission from their in-laws to gather at the day care center for the training, which further got converted into their support and appreciation. â??Earlier my father-in-law and husband didnâ??t want me to go to the training center but seeing our work they were equally excited,â?? Jwala Kanwar told VillageSquare.in. â??They were happy when I got my first remuneration.â??\r\n\r\nIcharaj Kanwar, a 43-year-old woman who lives with her two daughters and husband, said that she had never been a part of any such training before where she could explore and discover her abilities. â??Iâ??ve been doing only household all my age. Now that I have learnt this art, it has become another source of income,â?? said Icharaj, who also sells buttermilk and ghee. Icharaj excels in tying fabric in multiple patterns.\r\n\r\nOf late this art has become the bread and butter of many families in the village. Women who earlier had no source of income other than selling milk products, are now getting small orders for making tie and dye dupattas and sarees, which earns them a little income. â??I had never imagined that I could earn money on my own. It feels incredible when your hard work pays,â?? Santosh Kanwar, one of the women, told VillageSquare.in.\r\n\r\nRevival of a traditional handicraft\r\n\r\nRevival of the traditional handicraft of the desert is bringing women into the foreground. At the same time, they are earning without moving out from their houses. This small move by women towards their own development will bring an unexpected change in the village as well as their future generations.\r\n\r\nThe new experience has already started boosting the confidence among the artisans. They now feel more responsible towards their work. â??If we talk about gender equality, we are equally responsible to earn for our families, not only our men,â?? said 30-year-old Manju Daak.\r\n\r\nJigyasa Mishra is a writer based out of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.','2017-06-27 09:59:15',1,1,'/home/rahul/blogimages/1.jpeg'),(2,'From Junk to DNA & More, These Kids Turned Their Schoolyard Waste Into a Science Park!','Believing that â??charity begins at homeâ??, students at JUSCO School South Park in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, set out brainstorming over what problems they could address in their school. One boy, 13-year-old Akshit, expressed that he had difficulty understanding the concept of â??direct proportionality between time period and length of the pendulumâ?? in science. Investigating this difficulty, the students realised that several others from grades VI through X, besides Akshit, similarly experienced difficulty in grasping science concepts, such as the double helical structure of a DNA.\r\n\r\nThe students â?? Rishabh Tiwary, Afsha Nigar, Akarsh Narayan, Sonali Saurav, Minali Gupta, Kunal Mohanta, Ayush Tiwary, Tezender Singh and Shaista Naz â?? organised a meeting with their science teacher Mili Sinha and Principal Shovna De.\r\n\r\nThe group collectively came up with the idea to make a Science Park so that students could learn science concepts through a play-way method.\r\n\r\nInstead of hiring a specialist to design the park or buying science equipment from a branded agency, the students decided to put the waste material that was lying in JUSCOâ??s junkyard to better use. Scavenging for usable pipes and sheets, they worked with a blacksmith to make the science gadgets, with the whole exercise bringing the staff and students together.Using waste material, the students designed a total of ten gadgets across fields like genetics, mechanics, sound and light â?? through periodic tables, a DNA double helix, pulleys, musical pipes, optical illusions, etc.','2017-06-27 10:01:08',1,2,'/home/rahul/blogimages/2.jpeg'),(3,'What Precisely Are NGOs, and How Do They Play an Active Engaging Role in Society?','The 23rd of June 2017 marks the United Nations Public Service Day. It is a day to remember and recognize the contribution and value of public service to community. Public services require dedication, perseverance, and fresh energy brought in by the youth. This day also serves to encourage more and more people to take up careers in public services and contribute to the development process. In this context, we would like to share our thoughts on the Indian public services.\r\n\r\nG-O, or Government Order, in any country forms a pedestal for government administration and a tool to execute political priorities.\r\n\r\nThe connotations of the two letters G-O in our country would be far different from that perceived in the west. Perhaps, largely meaning to say that issuing a G-O in the West would be considered synonymous with implementation of the said G-O. Thus, when a law is well implemented and gets paralleled with effective enforcement mechanisms, it goes to reflect the systemâ??s preparedness and commitment to the republic.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for a citizen to remark that the system has failed to implement change. But an important point to consider is that the word â??implementâ?? emerges as a combination of two interdependent words, â??dutiesâ?? and â??responsibilitiesâ??. While we often look at whether the government has been unable to perform its duties, seldom do we ponder about the responsibilities bestowed onto the citizen. Thus, while the bureaucracy would play a key role in implementation of a G-O, it equally rests on the responsible shoulders of the citizen.\r\n\r\nHere, it stands to fact, that NGOs will have to play a key role in creating awareness among the public, and become extended arms of the government to assist them in the process. These individuals/organizations also extract perceptions, predilections, and road blocks from society towards policies that could serve to plan frameworks for better implementation.\r\n\r\nWhat complicates matters further is the grappling of the government machinery owing to shortage of manpower, resource crunch, and a precedent of political or bureaucratic priorities. To sum it all, while NGOs may not contribute majorly to the GDP of the economy, their role in the human development index or social progression index is irrefutable. Rightfully they are called NGOs, and not AGOs (Anti-Government Organizations).\r\n\r\nSo here are a few things you may want to know more about the technical side of NGOs.\r\n\r\nWhat is an NGO?\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems like a very simple question, the answer is not easy to find. One of the reasons is the interchangeable use of several terms like NGO (non-governmental organization), NPO (non-profit organization), CSO (civil society organization), TSO (third sector organization), VSO (voluntary sector organization), CBO (community-based organization), GRO (grass roots organization), and so on and so forth. According to the United Nations, any kind of private organization that is independent from government control can be termed an â??NGOâ??, provided it is not for profit.\r\n\r\nHow do NGOs play an active engaging role in society?\r\n\r\nTraditionally, NGOs can play three important roles, as an implementer, a catalyst, and a partner. Although implementer has the connotation of being the direct implementer of a programme, in our experience, unless the implementer has a strong G-O and understands the same, he/she would not be able to do justice to the role. Building the capacity for effective implementation is equally, if not more, important than the actual implementation itself.\r\n\r\nNGOs also have a significant role as catalysts in understanding issues by interacting with various stakeholders, especially those whom government inaction affects most, and to bring the issue to the notice of the policymakers. The government cannot be present everywhere all the time. It has its own powers as well as limitations.','2017-06-27 10:01:57',1,3,'/home/rahul/blogimages/3.jpeg'),(4,'This Former Banker Gave up His Job Overseas to Become an Educator in India','â??What do you want to be when you grow up?â?? The most consistent question we tend to hear since our childhood. Making the right career choice is as important as choosing a life partner. In the line of careers and education, you end up marrying the subject for the rest of your life, and it continues to impact your career choices and job openings. Thus, it is best to select a profession that is determined by your passion.\r\n\r\nIt is a common occurrence, when most of us feel stuck in careers like round pins in square holes. The moment you feel torn between your profession and passion, itâ??s probably the right time to do some thinking. Arjun Puri sets an example for all those who want to walk on the path of passion. His life story and career path are a perfect balance between success and satisfaction. Tanvi Kamdar of UnivAssist speaks to Arjun and finds out how he made such a massive shift in terms of careers, and what is it that keeps him going.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Kolkata, Arjunâ??s lineage is an amalgamation of literary and cinematic flair. His great-grandfather is Manish Ghatak, the renowned Bengali poet and novelist, his great-uncle Ritwik Ghatak, the Padma Shri-winning filmmaker. Mahashweta Devi, awardee of the Padma Vibhushan, is a great-aunt, his mother is Ina Puri (writer and two-time National Award-winning filmmaker), and his father Ravi Puri gained over 30 years of experience at ITC. It was Arjunâ??s parents who encouraged him to pursue his passion. Needless to mention, Arjunâ??s inclination towards arts and literature was no surprise at all.\r\n\r\nFrom School till College                                                             \r\n\r\nArjunâ??s career journey began like any other regular Indian student. He completed his schooling from one of the oldest schools of India, La Martiniere for Boys, Kolkata, also known as â??the Eton of the Eastâ??. Arjun was the 167th School Captain of La Martiniere, an achievement he still holds close.Post his schooling, Arjun went ahead and pursued a degree in International Business from the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. While these major career choices were made taking into consideration the popularity of the programme and certain other factors, Arjun feels there were missing links in the entire story. His innate desire was to study English or History, and he wished he had made that choice early on and was given the opportunity to explore and experiment.\r\n\r\nThe Corporate Grind\r\n\r\nAn ardent Arsenal fan, Arjun later landed in London, where he started his career as a banker with Merrill Lynch. Going through this corporate grind, the storyteller within him started to feel shelved. More than banking, his focus shifted on the stories around him.It was at this point that he decided to take a plunge and do what he felt passionate about. Though the thought of moving back had occurred to him earlier, it wasnâ??t a very serious one until then. After spending four years in London, it had become a home away from home. But like many others, Arjun was not looking forward to acquiring citizenship.\r\n\r\nHe was proud of owning an Indian passport, and never thought of giving it up.\r\n\r\nRemembering the exact moment when he decided to move back to India, he explains, â??It was on the way to work, and I sat in a carriage on the Tube. The Central Line (Red) to St. Paulâ??s. That morning, I kept sitting in the carriage, way past my stop. As dramatic as it may sound, I chose not to get down. I looked around, and like every single morning for over four years, I saw the same group of people, dressed in suits and clutching their copies of the Financial Times. I knew I didnâ??t fit and had overstayed my time in my favorite city, London.â??\r\n\r\nLondon to Bihar\r\n\r\nArjun moved back to India in the fall of 2011 and joined ITCâ??s rural development and farmer empowerment programme, E-Choupal. Moving from London to a small village that didnâ??t have running electricity was not very easy for him. What kept him going was the mantra, â??I had chosen to undertake this journey and I will see it through.â?? As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Arjun started enjoying his work. Meeting more people led to many colorful conversations and stories.\r\n\r\nHe chose this field consciously and enjoyed advising students and making an impact early for these young lives.\r\n\r\nPresently, Arjun works as the Head of Admissions and Outreach for the O. P. Jindal Global University and heâ??s also a member of the faculty at the Jindal School of Liberal Arts and Humanities. His aim is to share his personal experience and guide students in the right direction. He believes that holistic education is the need of the hour.\r\n\r\nArjun also makes it a point to share this valuable knowledge at various conferences, student meetings, and other education summits. His next speaking engagement will be at the IC3 Conference in August 2017. This conference brings together school leaders, college counselors, teachers, and university representatives to drive transformative counseling and admissions practices in the higher education community.

All to Make Agriculture More Efficient & Profitable','Most Indian youth do not look beyond a corporate or government job when they are charting out their career path. The security offered by salaried jobs is perceived to be irreplaceable. A job in the social sector is seen as the domain of social workers who sacrifice everything for the greater good. But increasingly, working in the social sector requires a balance between having a â??businessâ?? mind and a â??socialâ?? heart. Most social entrepreneurs lead financially secure lives, with the added satisfaction of doing something good and transforming lives. Yet, not many have the courage to take this less taken path.\r\n\r\nOne such path-breaker is Ashwin Mahavadi, a social entrepreneur. Having studied Civil Engineering at IIT Guwahati, Ashwinâ??s interest in education that could be put to practical use led him to join UC Berkeley for Masters In Structural Engineering. His experience at UC Berkeley provided him with a diverse perspective about the engineering space and the world beyond engineering. He also volunteered at the Association for Indiaâ??s Development (AID) at UC Berkeley to understand the landscape of Indiaâ??s diverse cultural, economic, and social sectors, soon realizing that they provide huge potential for development.\r\n\r\nOn completing his post-graduation, Ashwin worked for five-and-a-half years as an earthquake engineer on dams and nuclear plants. His experience there helped him understand how simple concepts in engineering could be connected to real-world applications.\r\n\r\nHaving always felt deeply connected to India and its development, Ashwin moved back to India in 2016. He aimed to empower and help the rural poor leverage their existing talent using his knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nWith a clear goal of providing the same opportunities to marginalised producers in rural India that are available to people in urban areas, he decided to first focus on the biggest demographic that he could impact â?? farmers.\r\n\r\nHe soon realized that the current agriculture supply-chain has several inefficiencies that decrease the parity between farmer income and consumer prices. In addition to various other socio-economic factors, the current model of input-intensive farming leaves the farmer perpetually indebted. Connecting this to his knowledge on supply-chain inefficiency, he started Advaita Organics.\r\n\r\nAdvaita Organics works towards creating a more efficient and sustainable agricultural supply chain that increases farmer incomes. They solve problems using technology, and make agriculture more sustainable, even as they make organically grown, pesticide-free agricultural produce, an inherent part of the daily urban lifestyle through easy access.\r\n\r\nExploring the agricultural sector, he also started Krishi Yog, a platform connecting all the major players of the agriculture ecosystem. It focusses on empowering farmers by providing end-to-end support in input procurement, crop management, and marketing activities using the intervention of technology.\r\n\r\nAshwinâ??s vision is to reach out to a million farmers by 2025, providing opportunities equal to that of an urban employee.\r\n\r\nAshwin is funding both Advaita Organics and Krishi Yog with his own savings, and working on building them into sustainable social enterprises. As he looks to scale up Krishi Yog, he is being mentored by Krishnagopal, CEO, Access Livelihoods Consulting India Ltd. (ALC India). A 12-year-old social enterprise, ALC India is based out of Hyderabad. One of six organisations NITI Aayogâ??s Atal Innovation Mission recognises as an established incubation centre, it receives scale-up support.\r\n\r\nALC India wants to help more youngsters become social entrepreneurs like Ashwin. Hence, it is launching a two-year social entrepreneurship fellowship, Transforming India Initiative (TII). The TII fellowship is a one-of-its-kind programme. It will enable fellows to discover, dream, design, and develop their own enterprises. Along the way, they will work directly with the founders towards accelerating existing social enterprises.\r\n\r\nALC India will provide complete ecosystem support to TII fellows to enable them to establish their own enterprises. In two years, the fellows will move from being job seekers to job creators with a cause. They will be imbibed with all the skills and mindsets required to be successful entrepreneurs during the two years. Also, for the ensuing six years after the fellowship, they will continue to receive support. This will include incubation support, funds, resources, and mentoring required for them to launch and grow their enterprise.','2017-06-27 10:03:51',1,5,'/home/rahul/blogimages/5.jpeg'),(6,'India Has New Rules to Regulate Dog Breeding. Here Are 10 Reasons to Celebrate Them','Dog breeding has become a multi-crore industry, involving thousands of breeders and pet shops. Like any commercial activity of this scale, protections must be in place to ensure transparency.\r\n\r\nIf your four-legged friend came from one of Indiaâ??s many unlicensed breeders, itâ??s very possible that he is the product of intensive, and potentially inhumane, breeding practices.\r\n\r\nAfter years of campaigning by animal welfare organisations, the government has stepped in to tackle some of the animal cruelty issues associated with commercial dog breeding. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing) Rules, 2017 were notified into law by the Ministry of Environment & Forests at the end of May 2017. Here are 10 reasons why we should all be celebrating these new rules:\r\n\r\n1. Under the new rules, every breeder must have a certificate of registration, issued after an inspection by the Animal Welfare Board of India, and renewable every two years. This should put a stop to some of the most extreme animal cruelty cases uncovered in commercial breeding facilities, which include dogs being kept in cages for extended periods of time without adequate food or access to veterinary care.\r\n\r\n2. Individuals who have been convicted of any offence under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (or the Wildlife Protection Act) are not eligible to be registered as breeders, taking the worst offenders out of the system for good.\r\n\r\n3. The Animal Welfare Board now has the right to inspect any breeding establishment for any reason, including on the receipt of a complaint from the public. If you come across dogs being kept for sale inappropriately, you now have the power to ensure the situation is looked into seriously.\r\n\r\n4. Overall, the new rules provide a stronger hand for dealing with breeders, and separating those who breed irresponsibly by holding violators of the new rules accountable. If violators are found by the Animal Welfare Board of India, then they can cancel licences and file police complaints.\r\n\r\n5. Another benefit of the new regulations is that they specify that pups cannot be sold under the age of eight weeks. Studies show that dogs can develop social anxiety if separated from their mothers and litter-mates before this age.\r\n\r\n6. Due to lack of appropriate care, pups from mass commercial breeders are often diseased, weak, and generally unhealthy animals, resulting in heavy mortality. Under the new rules, only vaccinated dogs who meet certain health criteria can be sold. Each pup sold should be micro-chipped, and their treatment and vaccinations properly recorded. This makes it much easier for buyers to track the care that their dog has received, and also encourages breeders to take care of the health of dogs.\r\n\r\n7. Impulse purchases based solely on appearance have been common. This often leads to abandonment of dogs when purchasers arenâ??t counselled appropriately to ensure that the dog is a good fit. The new rules explicitly state that breeders should not display dogs in public places for immediate sale, which gives them time to counsel the purchasers to ensure they can take proper care of the dog.\r\n\r\n8. Some of the worst cases of animal cruelty concern â??breedingâ?? dogs . Itâ??s common for female dogs to undergo breeding twice a year for multiple years, with little or no veterinary care.\r\n\r\n9. The practice of abandoning (or even killing) dogs who donâ??t meet arbitrary standards, or are no longer â??usefulâ?? (for example, â??breedingâ?? dogs who are no longer fertile) is a major cruelty issue. Abandonment is not only traumatic for the animal, but also contributes to the street dog population. It is also a major strain on the resources of animal rescue centres.\r\n\r\nBreeders must now rehabilitate pups not sold within six months via an animal welfare organisation. They must also maintain a full record of the number of dogs who are born, or die, in their care. A veterinary doctor must record the cause of death, after conducting a post-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n10. Pedigree dogs, by their very nature, have a range of genetic issues due to generations of selective breeding. For example, Saint Bernards have hip and elbow dysplasia, pugs have skin and breathing issues, etc. Inbreeding can worsen these traits. The new rules demand better record-keeping. Thus, there are disincentives to breed dogs with near-relatives, as there is a paper trail accessible to potential buyers.\r\n\r\nWhile the Dog Breeding & Marketing Rules are a step in the right direction, they will only work if consumers are aware of them, and refuse to buy pups from unlicensed sellers.','2017-06-27 10:06:47',1,6,'/home/rahul/blogimages/6.jpeg'),(7,'For 60 Years, Healthcare Workers Have Been Helping Indiaâ??s Villages Battle Mental Health Issues','In India, mental disorders are experienced and understood in a different way as compared to the Western and other Eastern countries. Even within India, there is diversity in the approaches towards mental illnesses, and the greatest contrast is seen between the urban and rural expanses.\r\n\r\nIndia is a blend of individualistic and collectivistic cultures, and community living is one of the most identifiable features of Indian living. The family and community serve as a large support system for individuals, and especially for those suffering from illnesses (mental and physical). Family members and society are the caretakers/care-givers in rural communities, where the village thrives as one large family and treatment resources are scarce.\r\n\r\nThe history of community mental healthcare dates back to 1954, when the All India Institute of Mental Health was established in Bangalore (under the Bhore committee) and Dr. Vidhya Sagar involved the family members of those suffering from mental illnesses in the management through an open tent pitched in the hospital campuses, as institutionalized treatment for mental health treatment was deemed important.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the late 1960s and 1970s, it was realized that long term institutional care for mental illnesses was neither desirable nor feasible, since the institutional set-up catered to merely 20-30 % of the patients who required mental health care. It was then that the deinstitutionalized movement took place and brought the modality of mental healthcare to the community (from the hospitals or institutions).\r\n\r\nCommunity care, since then, has been emphasized and worked upon in order to treat and rehabilitate people battling mental health issues. Community care, in essence, meant the setting up of community psychiatry units in order to reach and treat many more people.\r\n\r\nHowever, till date, treatment gap remains an issue, not only in India but in several other countries.\r\n\r\nIn India, mental illnesses share 6 % of the health burden, a mere 1.2 % of GDP is for the mental health budget, and poor infrastructure is an endemic problem. Hence, the treatment gap for mental health provisions heightens due to the limited professional help available to provide mental healthcare. The treatment gap in India is particularly large. In some rural areas, there is often just one doctor per 30,000 people.\r\n\r\nThe Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs) serve as an asset that can help bridge the crisis of the treatment gap. Community mental health (CMH) is a pattern of mental health, mental healthcare, and other services for people suffering from mental illnesses.\r\n\r\nCMH is a model of treatment that helps reduce the burden of mental illnesses by providing affordable care to people distressed with mental health issues. CMHWs are able to reach out to many more people in the community who canâ??t get treatment due to several reasons such as lack of accessibility to mental health clinics, financial limitations, and stronger beliefs in traditional treatment methods that fail to be adequate enough for betterment.\r\n\r\nCommunity mental healthcare is more responsive to local needs, given its base in the context of the community.\r\n\r\nThree resources are crucial in the development of the community mental healthcare movement in India:\r\n\r\n    1.Realization in the western countries that institutional treatment of mental illnesses may rather be counterproductive, after having witnessed the social breakdown syndrome that resulted from long-term hospitalization.\r\n    2.Institution-based psychiatric services are expensive, and low-income countries like India will not be able manage the manpower and resources necessary to deliver the services.\r\n    3.A discovery in the poorer countries found that para-professionals and non-professionals could receive short innovative training in order to make them capable of providing reasonably adequate mental healthcare services.\r\n\r\nThus, these three factors influenced the community mental healthcare system in India, which continues to grow till date. Community mental health workers belong to the community and know the people and the context of their mental illnesses. They voluntarily take up the training with the goal of benefitting society. CMHWs bring mental healthcare at a more affordable and accessible rate for rural communities. Given that they belong to the community, people of these communities find the CMHWs more approachable, reliable, and empathetic.\r\n\r\nThe mental health training programme for CMHWs is usually a 4-7 day course. It aims to increase recognition of mental disorders and enhance appropriate response and referral. It also aims to support people with mental disorders and their families, and improve mental health promotion in communities. As part of the training, recruited people of the communities receive training to identify signs, recognize symptoms, and counsel patients.','2017-06-27 10:07:32',1,7,'/home/rahul/blogimages/7.jpeg'),(8,'How You Can Teach English to the Underprivileged & Change Their Lives for the Better','You can give back to society in a lot of ways. You can volunteer to build houses for the poor, sweep the streets as part of â??Swachh Bharatâ??, distribute â??party-leftoverâ?? food to the homeless, take part in protest marches for causes close to your heart â?? the list just goes on.\r\n\r\nBut there is something you could do that could have more sustainable impact than any of the above activities. You donâ??t even have to go out of your way to do it. It can all be done at your very home. What is it? Itâ??s nothing but teaching English.\r\n\r\nI am going to tell you why teaching English, in the present times, is the most sustainable good that you can give back to society.\r\n\r\nThe days of traditional media (newspaper, TV channels) coverage are gone. They just cannot cover 1.3 billion Indians. Look around. Now itâ??s all about personal media. People are voicing their concerns through blogs, Facebook, and Twitter, and gathering like-minded people to support their causes from across the globe. You can find an Indian, a Chinese national, and a Mexican championing the same cause. How is that possible? Itâ??s simple â?? they speak the language of the internet, i.e. English, and know how to use social media.\r\n\r\nThe penetration of these social media channels is very deep (Twitter has 22.2 million users, Facebook has 142 million, with 90 % using mobile to access it). But Indians who really have concerns that threaten their very existence are not able to speak for themselves through these freely available social media platforms. Why? Because these Indians at the bottom of the pyramid donâ??t even know enough English to form a 140-character tweet. Without English, these people perpetually wait for external journalists to cover their stories and build traction around them.\r\n\r\nBut the brighter side of the story is that the mobile penetration is very high in India, i.e. around 70 % of the Indian population has mobile phones. Some studies say that there are more mobile phones than toilets in India. This penetration is only expected to grow. I am sure that five years down the line, even the simplest phones will allow Facebook and Twitter accessibility. So social media, like mobile phones, will eventually prevail amongst the folks at the bottom of the pyramid. You can already see signs of this, canâ??t you?\r\n\r\nSo we must empower these people who always get the raw deal â?? who are at the receiving end of corruption â?? with one skill that can empower them to voice their concerns directly without a facilitator. The skill is nothing but the ability to speak and write legible English.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of English can open up new and significantly better job avenues. This can translate into a significant increase in cash streams for people from underprivileged backgrounds. But Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, and the like â?? the new-age employers â?? expect even their most blue-collar workers to know how to use their applications, send SMS updates to customers, do Google searches, and write occasional emails. Without a working knowledge of English, doing these activities becomes very difficult.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for these door-to-door delivery, cab service, and similar blue-collar roles, the point of selection for these firms is often based on English skills.\r\n\r\nIf you teach kids English, the language skills will spread to the parents, and if you teach the mother, then it will spread across the family in the fastest possible manner. You must remember that teaching a person does not mean that your impact is limited to that person. It always spreads. The effect is always multiplied. The whole family learns English because one person in the family is being taught English.\r\n\r\nIn todayâ??s age, ghettos are slowly disappearing, and the haves and the have-nots are living closer to each other than ever before. They are next-door neighbors sometimes, particularly in the cities. Because the aspirations, needs, and social norms for these two groups differ considerably, friction is bound to arise. Friction arises between these communities mainly because they donâ??t understand each other. In other words, they are not â??sensitizedâ?? to each otherâ??s social norms. Thatâ??s why scenes of eve-teasing, catcalling, and physical violence are still not uncommon in the urban landscape.\r\n\r\nWell, you can play a special role here. By teaching a have-not person English, you can also sensitize him to the lifestyle and social norms that the middle-class (which is of course English speaking) follows. He will listen to you more than anyone else on this topic. Why? Because you have gained his trust through your teaching efforts. I told my student, who was a mess worker then, about drinking with caution, the importance of female empowerment, and peaceful negotiation. He just listened, and gradually started following what I advised. It works!\r\n\r\nNow you know how powerful a change teaching English could bring. But think about this â?? India lacks 12 lakh teachers in its schools at present. What about teaching illiterate adults? No government would ever be able to arrange enough full-time teachers to teach the more than 287 million illiterate Indians.\r\n\r\nThatâ??s where we, the English speakers of the country, will play a decisive role. We can pitch in to teach the illiterate children and adults, who the government couldnâ??t reach out to, in our spare time, canâ??t we?','2017-06-27 10:08:20',1,8,'/home/rahul/blogimages/8.jpeg'),(9,'I Worked with Dr. Kalam for over 20 Years & Have Fond Memories of Our Morning Walk Conversations','The morning walk was one activity Dr. Kalam never missed throughout his life. I had the opportunity to join him on a number of occasions. It was his private time, and he generally preferred to do it alone. I understood this, thus I quietly listened to his views on nature for most of the time. My interactions with him during our morning walks started after he moved to Delhi. Of course, it was also a special experience to walk with a person with Z-security, with armed guards moving along with us. This was the time he kept himself totally free from formal thoughts, and spent his time enjoying nature, talking about the flowers and trees.\r\n\r\nHe used to talk of the rocks of Hyderabad, and the need for green cover. Perhaps he used morning walks to develop his passion for writing poetry, and his ideas for the messages he later conveyed in his books.\r\n\r\nI used to enjoy the morning walks with him. There were a couple of occasions, however, when I was caught on the wrong foot and spoiled his mood. Due to a perceived familiarity, I crossed my limits, took liberty, and passed comments without realizing the reaction they might elicit.\r\n\r\nI would like to talk about two of these instances.\r\nThe first came when his maiden book of poetry was published. Dr. Kalam had always been a very passionate poet. I came to know from his college classmates that he loved to write. When we noticed him writing something during meetings, we thought he was noting down points. During one such occasion, I casually peeped to see what was he writing. It was a Tamil poem. He wrote only for his personal satisfaction, and at the time did not realize the power of his messages.\r\n\r\nHis first book of poems was translated to English and released in Administrative College of India. During the morning walk the next day, he asked me about my impression of the book. I did not realize that he was so enthusiastic and happy about the release of his maiden attempt. My immediate reply was that the poems translated into English by a third person lacked the punch provided in the original Tamil version. He gave a very disappointed look and walked away from me.\r\n\r\nLater, he published many books. Even though in that instant I felt right about communicating my frank opinion, I realized that he expected a lot of appreciation for achieving what he wanted to after many years.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion was a more serious one. Dr. Kalam was declared as a Presidential candidate when he was at Anna University, Chennai. The next day after the announcement, he was at DRDL, Hyderabad. I went to meet him during the early morning hours. The entire guest house area was cordoned off by police and they did not let me enter. I was standing in the garden when Dr. Kalam came out and asked me to join him in the walk. Of course, this time, apart from the Z-security guards, a big crowd of officials followed us at a distance of 100 m.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour-long walk. He was very happy to walk in the place he had developed into a great campus. He recalled his visit to the same place years before he joined DRDL, and he felt a positive energy that indicated to him the power of the place. I jovially mentioned to him that I purchased a number of wall hangings depicting messages from the Bhagavad Gita and passed them on to those who had depression. He liked the verse I narrated.\r\n\r\nThings were going well when, all of a sudden, Dr. Kalam shot a question at me, â??What is the reaction of people to me getting nominated for the President position?â??\r\n\r\nI was not ready for the answer to this, and replied immediately that all were very happy about the decision. I went on to say that some were not very sure about his performance since he was not exposed to politics. In hindsight, I should have stopped with this.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing the implication, I added further that those persons did not know what he was capable of. This answer irritated him a lot. He raised his voice and asked me, â??What are you saying? Do you mean I am a politician?â?? I realized that I had spoken too much, and to pacify him and justify my statement, I went on to say that he had been in Delhi for a long time, moved with politicians, ministers, and prime ministers. Persons moving closely with politicians were bound to be more comfortable handling the position of President.\r\n\r\nUnhappy with my answer, he walked ahead. We sat for a while on the steps. He called his car and moved out. The crowd of officials who witnessed this conversation were very unhappy with me.\r\n\r\nThey charged me, saying, â??He was OK in the beginning, and you spoiled his mood.â??\r\n\r\nLater in the office, he addressed a small group of scientists. He was happy when one of my friends mentioned that all these days we had known the President, and now we could boldly say that the President knew us. He then left for Delhi.\r\n\r\nI came home, and was watching TV that evening. The news channels were telecasting a live interview with Dr. Kalam in front of the guest house where he was staying. One of the reporters asked him how he could be a Presidential candidate, being a person with no political background. Dr. Kalam gave a prompt reply, â??Who says that I am new to politics? I have handled a number of prime ministers, ministers, and members of parliament at Delhi as the Secretary of DRDO. I am fully aware of the system.â?? The next question was, â??What is your message to the nation?â?? He replied with a rather familiar quote from the Bhagavad Gita.\r\n','2017-06-27 10:09:05',1,9,'/home/rahul/blogimages/9.jpeg'),(10,'Small Water Pumps Are Scripting Success Stories for Marginal Farmers in Assam','A few years ago, Umes Deka of Urangapara village in South Kamrup district of Assam was like any other smallholder farmer in the area, practicing agriculture that barely met the needs of his family. Today, he is a successful vegetable grower who is prospering by using a small pump to irrigate his field.\r\n\r\nâ??I learned how to grow potatoes when I worked with farmers doing vegetable cultivation in char (river island) areas. They were enterprising farmers and minimized costs in every way possible. Learning from them, I initiated vegetable cultivation on my field with the help of a small pump,â?? the sexagenarian farmer living near the town of Loharghat told VillageSquare.in. â??My field is next to a river, and I use both well and water from the river. Now I am trying my best to engage and earn as much as possible from my own fields.â??\r\n\r\nEngines of growth\r\n\r\nSmall and marginal farmers in South Kamrup, where homestead farming is practiced widely, have recently adopted new engines as tools to boost income from agriculture. These engines are small water pumps of less than 2 horsepower capacity, which are being used extensively to draw water from both surface and ground sources.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the recent announcement in the Budget of doubling farm incomes by 2022, and two years into the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana (Prime Ministerâ??s Farm Irrigation Scheme), can small pumps act as drivers to irrigate fields in the eastern parts of the country?\r\n\r\nTraditionally, farmers in South Kamrup have been practicing backyard farming, which is of no or little commercial value. While paddy cultivation is done by nearly everyone, vegetables for commercial purposes, such as ridge gourd, tomato, brinjal, pumpkin, chilli, etc., are finding inroads, and have been adopted by tribal farmers, which has led to substantial increase in incomes for them.\r\nThe rice fields of South Kamrup in Assam. (Photo by Bikalp Chamola)\r\n\r\nIrrigating small farms\r\n\r\nIt is commonly held that the chief reason for farm distress in India is the prevalence of dry land farming, with its dependence on an increasingly erratic monsoon. At the national level, over 50 % of the countryâ??s arable area does not have access to irrigation, constraining farmers to farming in only one season. This proportion rises for small farmers, and for western regions.\r\n\r\nHowever, strange though it may seem, using their wit and hard work, marginal farmers (with land holdings less than one hectare) seem to have a larger share of their holdings under irrigation. This highlights the startling fact that the smaller the landholding, the higher the irrigation coverage.\r\n\r\nIrrigation can be of flow type, from surface sources, or from ground water. Lacking the former two, western India seems to get most of its irrigation from groundwater aquifers. Since these regions also see greater stress on farming, higher intensification of agriculture has led to unsustainable withdrawal. There is, therefore, a need to reevaluate methods to irrigate farmland in India.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, eastern landscapes have not used much of their abundant groundwater. A manifestation of this is that while in Banaskantha district in Gujarat, the maximum depth in the water table in January 2016 was 59 m. below ground level (BGL), the worst level in Assam was only 19 m. BGL, in Dhubri district. Yet, groundwater does not seem to be fully used for irrigation in the east, as the total irrigation cover is still less than 5 % in a state like Assam.\r\nGround level study\r\n\r\nAfter interacting with 67 farmers in South Kamrup district who are using small and large pumps, to see how the two types of irrigation fared, a study conducted by the Centre for Development Research found that a large number of large pump users had shifted to using small pumps.\r\n\r\nAbout two decades ago, shallow tube wells powered with 4-6 hp pumps formed a popular irrigation mechanism in Kamrup. For a state with 85 % of sites having water available at less than 5 m. below ground level, this is quite surprising. Large withdrawals of water for growing paddy, coupled with less on-farm control on water, led to unsustainable withdrawals. This led to disuse of the pumps and a stop on their spread despite easy availability in the market. In recent times, the smaller farmers have now begun shifting to small pumps.\r\n\r\nThey are using them not so much for paddy, but for less thirsty crops.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the spread of small pumps is the much lower capital cost. A small electric pump of 1.5 hp costs barely â?¹8,000 and can be run on a domestic power line. This contrasts with larger capacity pumps whose prices could be much higher, including special power transmission arrangements. Similar comparison on costs puts small diesel pumps ahead of larger ones. While reduced to per hp, the capital cost could be higher for smaller pumps, the fact is that the extra power is redundant in the view of easy access to water in abundant aquifers.\r\n\r\nEven the paddy growers among the users have little reason to despair. The region has huge standing surface water sources and abundant rainfall. So, dry patches are few and far in-between, needing only small critical irrigation, which the small pumps can support. These are therefore making inroads to act as alternatives to the larger capacity pumps for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAdvantage of small pumps\r\n\r\nThe best advantage with small pumps is that they are lighter and can be easily carried from one point to another. This helps a farmer carry it to his different parcels of land. The lightweight pumps, coupled with the fact that electric connections tend to be fixed, means that small capacity diesel pumps are more popular among the users of small pumps. This advantage beats the higher operating costs of small diesel pumps.\r\n\r\nAs fragmentation of land is lower in case of marginal farmers, the natural choice for them is an electric pump. Additionally, a small diesel pump and a small electric pump cost no more than â?¹15,000 combined. Therefore, small farmers, who have much more scattered land than marginal farmers because of fragmentation, are using the pumps.\r\nDrivers of change\r\n\r\nWhat are the drivers of this change? Vegetables do not require the sort of volume of irrigation needed by paddy. Thus, not only are they better paying, they also need less water, which smaller pumps can supply. Increasing population and growth in urban centres has tended to push the demand for vegetables in the region. Small towns such as Bagan and Loharghat, too, see the presence of dealers purchasing vegetables in bulk. In fact, it is not a rare sight to see farmers carrying vegetables on boats to interior areas on smaller rivers.\r\n\r\nThe income per hectare of small and marginal farmers, owing to the intensive use of small pumps, is double that of semi-medium farmers. Also, small and marginal farmers have a much higher share of on-farm income in the total income of the household compared with semi-medium farmers.\r\n\r\nThus, we can easily conclude that small and marginal farmers are investing higher amounts of labour in agriculture compared with semi-medium farmers.\r\n\r\nThe study pointed to the fact that small pumps could be a viable solution for farmers with smaller landholdings, with easily available water and higher fragmentation of land. Even if the answer is an unequivocal yes, it still is the condition of a large number of farmers in a state like Assam.\r\n\r\nGiven the state of affairs, if provided with small pumps, and extending it to regions beyond South Kamrup, it is entirely possible to double the income of small and marginal farmers in Assam. Large numbers of farmers are still facing distress in agriculture, and migrating to cities. The government might want to intervene to reach them with a solution as simple as a small water pump.','2017-06-27 10:10:25',1,10,'/home/rahul/blogimages/10.jpeg'),(11,'Test Blog','<p><strong>Hello How are you?</strong></p>','2017-07-04 06:48:41',1,23,'/home/rahul/blogimages/11.jpeg'),(12,'New Blog','<p><strong>How they do it</strong>.</p>','2017-07-05 10:42:58',1,24,'/home/rahul/blogimages/12.jpeg'),(13,'MyBLOG','<p><strong>Never</strong> back down</p>','2017-07-08 18:03:33',1,25,'/home/rahul/blogimages/13.jpeg');
